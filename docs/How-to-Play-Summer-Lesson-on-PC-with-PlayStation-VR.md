Summer Lesson is not just a game, but an experience that showcases the potential and limitations of VR. The game puts you in the role of a tutor who visits a girl's house every day for a week and helps her with her studies. The game is divided into seven days, each with a different lesson and a different interaction with the girl.
 
The game's main attraction is the realistic and immersive depiction of the girl, Hikari Miyamoto. She is rendered in high-quality graphics and animated with lifelike expressions and movements. She reacts to your presence and your choices, and sometimes gets close to you or touches you. The game uses head tracking and voice recognition to let you communicate with her by nodding, shaking your head, or speaking simple phrases.
 
However, the game also has some drawbacks that may disappoint some players. The game is very short and linear, with little replay value. The game does not offer much gameplay or challenge, as the choices you make have little impact on the outcome. The game also does not have any sexual or romantic content, despite its suggestive premise. The game is more like a virtual friend simulator than a dating sim.
 
Summer Lesson is a game that may appeal to fans of Japanese culture and VR enthusiasts who want to experience something different. The game is not available in English, but it has English subtitles for the Asian version. The game is also exclusive to PlayStation VR, so you will need a PS4 and a PSVR headset to play it.
