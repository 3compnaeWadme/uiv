Hercules SETUP utility is a versatile tool that can communicate with various types of devices using serial port (RS-485 or RS-232), UDP/IP or TCP/IP protocols.

However, over time, it has evolved into a multifunctional utility that supports many features and is available for free to anyone who needs it.
